# WebSocket API Refactor v2 - COMPLETE âœ…

## Overview
Implementing a cleaner WebSocket API with dedicated manager service, URLPattern-based routing, and message multiplexing.

## Implementation Complete

All tasks implemented and tested. All tests passing.

### Feedback Fixes Applied

1. **Removed Redundant URLPattern Extraction**
   - Decorators (@upgrade, @message, @close) no longer re-extract URL params
   - BaseContext already extracts params during topic matching and spreads them into args
   - Simplified decorator code and removed unnecessary helper functions

2. **Cleaned Up Type Exports**
   - Removed old `BaseWebSocketActionArgs` export from index.ts
   - Now only export the specific, well-defined types:
     - `BaseWebSocketUpgradeArgs`
     - `BaseWebSocketMessageArgs`
     - `BaseWebSocketCloseArgs`

### Final Architecture

- **BaseWebSocketManager**: Singleton service managing connections with broadcast support
- **BaseWebSocketContext**: Handles registration, message multiplexing, and cleanup
- **Decorators**: @upgrade, @message, @close - all use URLPattern via BaseContext
- **Types**: Clean, specific types for each decorator's handler args
- **Tests**: All passing with proper DI mocking
